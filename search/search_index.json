The V-MOL provides training in computational mass spectrometry and data science of multi-omics experiments with the goal to launch virtual research projects as a new form of collaborative science. Projects \u00b6 Here is an abbreviated list of projects that are completed or in progress. Some early stage projects are not listed but if you want to learn about them or join, please come to our meetings.
