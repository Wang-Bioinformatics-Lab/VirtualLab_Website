## Mission

The V-MOL, led by Mingxun Wang, Allegra Aron and Daniel Petras aims to connect computational biologists/chemists around the globe in a virtual research group by removing physical and economical barriers of entry to science. The V-MOL provides training in computational mass spectrometry and data science of multi-omics experiments with the goal to launch virtual research projects as a new form of collaborative science.
